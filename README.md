# Options Data

Options analytics for the BTC market based on real-time and historical data feeds.

## Features

- `iv-surface` — fetches the full BTC option chain from Deribit, parses each instrument's strike and expiry, and plots the implied-volatility surface in 3D over **deltas** and **time to expiry**. IV values come directly from Deribit's `mark_iv`.
- `iv-curves` — reuses the same BTC option chain and plots the implied-volatility **smile** as 2D line curves, one per **expiry**, over **strike**. Each curve keeps the out-of-the-money leg (puts below the forward, calls above), so every expiry forms a clean U-shape. IV values come directly from Deribit's `mark_iv`.
- `term-structure` — plots the **ATM implied-volatility term structure** as a 2D line: one at-the-money IV point per **expiry**, spaced time-proportionally by **days to expiry**. The ATM IV is interpolated from each expiry's OTM smile to the forward (log-moneyness `ln(K/F) = 0`), revealing whether the vol market is in contango (upward) or backwardation (downward).
- `greeks` — computes the Black-76 option **greeks** (delta, gamma, theta, vega) for each contract in the OTM chain and plots each greek over **strike** for a selected **expiry**. Uses the forward convention already used for the surface/curves (undiscounted, `r = 0`, σ = `mark_iv`). Conventions: delta is dimensionless, gamma is per **$1** forward move, vega is per **1 vol-point** (1%), theta is per **calendar day**.
- `oi-by-expiration` — plots **open interest by expiration** as one stacked bar per **expiry**, split into **ITM/OTM calls and puts**. Unlike the IV/greeks views it uses the _full_ chain (every strike and expiry, dailies through LEAPS) and sums Deribit's per-contract `open_interest` (in **contracts**). Moneyness is classified by **strike vs the per-contract forward** (call ITM when `strike < forward`, put ITM when `strike > forward`) — no IV needed, so deep-ITM and illiquid but OI-heavy contracts are kept.

## Quick start (Docker)

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080**.
